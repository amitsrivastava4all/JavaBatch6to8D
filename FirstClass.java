class Calc{
int x,y; // Member  Variables
int add(){  // Member Functions
return x + y;
}

int subtract(){
return x - y;
}
}
class Customer
{
int x;
}
*/
class FirstClass
{
    // public - now u can access your things outside the package (folder)
    // static - it has only one copy in the memory
    // void - no return 
    // main - entry point for application
    // String - it is a predefine class in Java
    // String is a char array internally
    // String it is a collection of chars
    // args - it is just a variable and  name can be anything
    // args it is of array type 
    // String args[] - command line arguments
    
    public static void main(String arr[]){
        // System is a predefine class
        // and out is a predefine object
        // out is a object of PrintStream class
        // PrintStream has println method
        // println is used to print on console 
        // and it print in a new line
        System.out.println("Hello Java !");    
    }
